# Automation Test Trigger

Testing the claude-flow-hybrid-automation system.

@claude-flow-automation

This is a test comment to trigger the automation system and validate that our hybrid approach works correctly.

Expected behavior:
1. GitHub Actions should detect this @claude-flow-automation mention
2. Try to initialize claude-flow@alpha with SQLite workarounds
3. If successful: Use full Hive-Mind AI capabilities
4. If failed: Use fallback automation with clear limitations
5. Create a PR with the solution
6. Comment on the issue with results
